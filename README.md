# Spectator

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/elia/spectator)

_Test driven development red-green cycle for simple people!_

## The gist

Spectator is a simple watcher for your specs:
- it will execute a spec each time a file (spec or implementation) is modified or created (_really catches new files!_)
- it **does not** starts your whole suite at start, nor when a spec passes or fails (as autospec tends to do)
- _if you ask_ it runs the whole spec suite

> Started as a custom [Watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) script **Spectator** has grown up to a tiny gem!

### Compatibility

Works with RSpec-1 and RSpec-2 (looks for a `.rspec` file in the project root).


## Usage

Launch `spectator` in a terminal and go back to code!

The normal behavior is similar to `autotest --fast-start --no-full-after-failed`
but gives the user a bit more control over execution. By hitting CTRL+C (or CMD+. on OSX)
you get the following prompt:

    ^C (Interrupted with CTRL+C)
    --- What to do now? (q=quit, a=all-specs):

Type `q` and `ENTER` (or `CTRL+C` again) to quit.

Type `a` and `ENTER` (or `CTRL+C` again) to execute the whole suite of specs.


## Advanced (upcoming!)

If you want to override some path matching:

**`BASE_DIR_GLOB`:**

The glob that expanded will list the directories that contains the code. **Default:**


**`SPEC_DIR_GLOB`:**

The glob that expanded will list the directories that contains the specs. **Default:**

**`RSPEC_COMMAND`:**

The full command that will run your specs. **Default:** `bundle exec rspec` (or `bundle exec spec` for RSpec 1.x)


### Examples

#### Inline ENV variables

```shell
# this will match lib/opal/parser.rb to spec/cli/parser.rb
BASE_DIR_GLOB='lib/opal' SPEC_DIR_GLOB='spec/cli' spectator
```


#### Exported ENV variables

```shell
export BASE_DIR_GLOB="{opal/corelib,stdlib}"
export SPEC_DIR_GLOB="spec/{corelib,stdlib}"
export RSPEC_COMMAND="bundle exec mspec run -t ./bin/opal -I$(dirname $(gem which mspec)) -Ilib -rmspec/opal/mspec_fixes.rb"
spectator
```


#### With a `.spectator` config file

```yaml
# contents of ".spectator" file
BASE_DIR_GLOB: 'lib/opal'
SPEC_DIR_GLOB: 'spec/cli'
```

    spectator


#### Specifying a custom config file

```shell
# contents of ".my-spectator-config" file
BASE_DIR_GLOB: 'lib/opal'
SPEC_DIR_GLOB: 'spec/cli'
```

    spectator .my-spectator-config
